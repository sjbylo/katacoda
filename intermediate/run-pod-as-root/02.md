Now do the same with plain Docker.  You will see the container is allowed to run as root by default. 

Build the image:

``docker build -t mypod build-root``{{execute}}

Run the container:

``docker run -d --name my-root-container mypod``{{execute}}

Check the user ID of the container:

``docker exec my-root-container id``{{execute}}

You should see that it's allowed to run as root by default.

```
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

Next we'll change the security policy in OpenShift and try again.
