If this is the first time you are reading about Source-to-Image (S2I) it is strongly advised to start with one of the other introductory tutorials which shows [how to deploy an application from source code using an existing S2I Builder Image](https://learn.openshift.com/introduction/deploying-python/). 

However, the goal of this tutorial is to show how to *create* a simplified S2I Builder Image yourself and then use the same image to create another new image containing your application. 

This tutorial is divided into three parts.

1. Introduction to creating an S2I Builder Image.
2. Creating the S2I Builder Image.
3. Using the S2I Builder Image.
