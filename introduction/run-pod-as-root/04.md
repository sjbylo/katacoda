Repeat the same as before but using a non-root user ID.  Use the other Dockerfile in the _build-user_ directory. 

``oc start-build mypod --from-dir=build-user --follow --wait``{{execute}}

Note that when the pod is built again, the pod is automatically re-deployed as soon as the new image is pushed into the registry.

Fetch the running pod's ID and check the user ID:

``POD_ID=$(sh ~/get-pod-id mypod); echo $POD_ID``{{execute}}

``oc exec $POD_ID id``{{execute}}

You should be able to see it's running as user 1001 or the _default_ user, as defined in /etc/passwd.  Policies are quite flexible.
For example: containers can be allowed to run as any user ID, except root, which would be more secure than what we have done in this scenario. 

Explore what else can be done with policies.

``oc adm policy --help``{{execute}}
