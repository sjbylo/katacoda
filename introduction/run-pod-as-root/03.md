To allow OpenShift to run containers as any user or as root, log in as cluster-admin:

``oc login -u system:admin``{{execute}}

Change the policy for the default service account in your project to "anyuid":

``oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default -n myproject``{{execute}}

Now try again to run the container in OpenShift as root.

First, log back in as the developer user:

``oc login -u developer -p developer``{{execute}}

Ensure you are using the correct project:

``oc project myproject``{{execute}}

Let's deploy a fresh container by using the _rollout_ command:

``oc rollout latest mypod``{{execute}}

Again, fetch the pod id:

``POD_ID=$(sh ~/get-pod-id mypod); echo $POD_ID``{{execute}}

Check again which user the container is running as:

``oc exec $POD_ID id``{{execute}}

You should be able to see it's running as root.

```
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

We have changed the policy and can now run containers as root in this project. 

What about if I want to run a container using a very specific user ID?
