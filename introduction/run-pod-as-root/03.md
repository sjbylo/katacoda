# Allow OpenShift to run containers as any user or root.

To allow OpenShift to run containers as root, log in as cluster admin and run the following:

``oc login -u system:admin``{{execute}}

Change the policy for the default service account to "anyuid"

``oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default -n myproject``{{execute}}

Now try again to run the container in OpenShift as root.

Let's deploy a fresh container by using the _rollout_ command.

``oc rollout latest mypod``{{execute}}

Again, fetch the pod id

``POD_ID=$(oc get pods | grep mypod.*Running | awk '{print $1}' | tail -1); echo $POD_ID``{{execute}}
``POD_ID=$(bash ~/get-pod-id mypod)``{{execute}}

Check again which user the container is running as:

``oc exec $POD_ID id``{{execute}}

You should be able to see it's running as root:

```
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
