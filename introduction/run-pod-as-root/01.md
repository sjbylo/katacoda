# Example of how to allow containers to run as root and/or a specific user ID.

To allow containers to run as root (or any user) in OpenShift you need to set the policy for the _default service account of your project_.

[Further information in the docs.](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/admin_guide/manage_scc.html#enable-dockerhub-images-that-require-root)

This is the simple Dockerfile we will use.  It simply builds an image and when launched, starts a long running process ``sleep 999999``.

```
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/rhel-atomic
COPY somefile /tmp
#USER 1001
USER 0
ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/bash", "-c", "id>/tmp/id;id;sleep 999999" ]
```

But first we will see what happens if we try to run a container as root on OpenShift.

---

# Show that containers running on OpenShift cannot run as root (by default).

```
oc login  -u developer -p developer
oc new-project myproject
```

Build a new example container in OpenShift using the above example Dockerfile. 
Ensure the Dockerfile contains "**USER 0**".

```
oc new-build --name pod-root --binary  # Create a new build config
oc start-build pod-root --from-dir=build --follow --wait   # Start the build, using the content of the current directory
oc new-app pod-root                    # Launch a pod
oc get po
```

``POD_ID=$(oc get pods | grep pod-root.*Running | awk '{print $1}' | tail -1); echo $POD_ID``{{execute}}

Remote shell (rsh) into the container and you will see it is running as non-root (not 0).

```
oc rsh <pod name>                     # Remote into the container to see which user ID it is running as. 
``oc exec $POD_ID id``{{execute}}
```

You can see that the container is running as uid=1000000 (or similar).  It is not running as root becasue OpenShift does not allow containers to run as root by default. 

Now do the same with plain docker.  You can see the container is allowed to run as root by default. 

Build the image.

``docker build -t pod-root build``{{execute}}

Run the container.

``docker run -it -d --name mycontainer pod-root``{{execute}}

Check the user id of the container. 

``docker exec mycontainer id``{{execute}}

You should see that it's allowed to run as root.

```
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

# Allow OpenShift to run containers as any user or root

To allow OpenShift to run containers as root, run the following as the project admin user (you created the project, you are the project admin user).

```
oc login -u admin       # Must be logged in and not just the system:admin user

oc project myproject   

oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default

# or run the equivilent command

# oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:myproject:default 

# Other useful commands

# Add authenitcated user group (all users) to the anyuid SCC
# oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:authenticated --as system:admin

# Remove authenitcated user group (all users) from the anyuid SCC
# oc adm policy remove-scc-from-group anyuid system:authenticated --as system:admin

oc edit scc anyuid  # verify the change 
```

Now try again to run the container in OpenShift as root.

Let's deploy a fresh container by using the rollout command.

``oc rollout latest pod-root``{{execute}}

``POD_ID=$(oc get pods | grep pod-root.*Running | awk '{print $1}' | tail -1); echo $POD_ID``{{execute}}

Check again which ID it's running as:

``oc exec $POD_ID id``{{execute}}

You should be able to see it's running as uid=root

``uid=root...``

Repeat the same above but using non-root user IDs, by changing the value of USER in the Dockerfile and re-building the container image. 

Example:

```
# edit the Dockerfile to switch between "USER 0" and "USER 1001"

oc start-build pod-root --from-dir=. # Start the build again

oc logs bc/pod-root -f               # View the docker build logs

oc rsh <pod>                         # Check if the container is running as root or not
```

Use the following command to explore what can be done with policies.

```
oc adm policy --help

Manage policy on pods and containers:
  add-scc-to-user                 Add users or serviceaccount to a security context constraint
  add-scc-to-group                Add groups to a security context constraint
  remove-scc-from-user            Remove user from scc
  remove-scc-from-group           Remove group from scc
```

If you were using docker, clean up your work with this command.  Careful, this will remove all running containers. 

```
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) 
```
